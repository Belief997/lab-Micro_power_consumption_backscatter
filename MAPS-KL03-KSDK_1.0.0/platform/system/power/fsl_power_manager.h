 *  mode - Kinetis power mode. List of available modes is chip-specific. See power_manager_modes_t
 *   list of modes. This item is common for all Kinetis chips.
 *  policy - Power mode change policy. Specifies whether the callbacks notified before the
 *   power mode change can prohibit the switch or callback notification results are ignored forcing
 *   the switch. This item is common for all Kinetis chips.
 *  sleepOnExitOption - Controls whether the sleep-on-exit option value is used (when set to true)
 *   or ignored (when set to false). See sleepOnExitValue. This item is common for all Kinetis chips.
 *  sleepOnExitValue - When set to true, ARM core returns to sleep (Kientis wait modes) or deep sleep
 *   state (Kinetis stop modes) after interrupt service finishes. When set to false, core stays
 *   woken-up. This item is common for all Kinetis chips.
 *  lowPowerWakeUpOnInterruptOption - Controls whether the wake-up-on-interrupt option value is used
 *   (when set to true) or ignored (when set to false). See lowPowerWakeUpOnInterruptOption. This
 *   item is chip-specific.
 *  sleepOnExitValue - When set to true, system exits to Run mode when any interrupt occurs while in
 *   Very low power run, Very low power wait or Very low power stop mode. This item is chip-specific.
 *  powerOnResetDetectionOption - Controls whether the power on reset detection option value is used
 *   (when set to true) or ignored (when set to false). See powerOnResetDetectionOption. This item is
 *   chip-specific.
 *  powerOnResetDetectionValue - When set to true, power on reset detection circuit is enabled in
 *   Very low leakage stop 0 mode. When set to false, circuit is disabled. This item is chip-specific.
 *  RAM2PartitionOption - Controls whether the RAM2 partition power option value is used (when set to

 *
 * This function switches to one of the defined power modes. Requested mode number is passed
 * as an input parameter. This function notifies all registered callback functions before
 * the mode change (using  kPowerManagerCallbackBefore set as callback type parameter),
 * sets specific power options defined in the power mode configuration and enters the specified
 * mode. In case of run modes (for example, Run, Very low power run, or High speed run), this function
 * also invokes all registered callbacks after the mode change (using kPowerManagerCallbackAfter).
 * In case of sleep or deep sleep modes, if the requested mode is not exited through
 * a reset, these notifications are sent after the core wakes up.
 * Callbacks are invoked in the following order: first, all dynamically registered callbacks
 * are invoked ordered by the priority set during their registrations (see
 * POWER_SYS_RegisterCallbackFunction). Then all statically registered callbacks are notified
 * ordered by index in the static callbacks array (see callbacksPtr parameter of POWER_SYS_Init()).
 * The same order is used for before and after switch notifications.
 * The notifications before the power mode switch can be used to obtain confirmation about
 * the change from registered callbacks. If any registered callback denies the power
 * mode change, further execution of this function depends on mode change policy defined
 * in the user power mode configuration (see policy in the power_manager_user_config_t): the mode
 * change is either forced (kPowerManagerPolicyForcible) or exited (kPowerManagerPolicyAgreement).
 * When mode change is forced, the result of the before switch notifications are ignored. If
 * agreement is required, if any callback returns an error code then further notifications
 * before switch notifications are cancelled and all already notified callbacks are re-invoked
 * with kPowerManagerCallbackAfter set as callback type parameter. The handler of the callback
 * which returned error code during pre-switch notifications is stored (any error codes during
 * callbacks re-invocation are ignored) and POWER_SYS_GetErroneousDriver() can be used to get it.
 * Regardless of the policies, if any callback returned an error code, an error code denoting in which phase
 * the error occurred is returned when POWER_SYS_SetMode() exits.
 * It is possible to enter any mode supported by the processor. Refer to the chip reference manual
 * for list of available power modes. If it is necessary to switch into intermediate power mode prior to

 * configuration structure (see power_manager_policy_t). When the power mode is switched (in cases of run modes)
 * or exited without a reset (in cases of sleep modes) then callbacks registered with kPowerManagerCallbackAfter
 * or kPowerManagerCallbackBeforeAfter are invoked. Registered callback is invoked during each POWER_SYS_SetMode()
 * call. An order of invocation of callbacks is specified by priority number (see power_manager_callback_priority_t).
 * Callbacks with lower priority number are called first. In cases of multiple callbacks having the same priority,
 * the first registered callback is serviced as first (FIFO). When called, reference to
 * power_manager_callback_data_t registered with the callback are passed to the callback by the power manager,
 * along with reference to power mode configuration reference to provide callback with all necessary
 * information about power mode which being entered.
 * Following successful registration, a handle identifying the callback is returned. This handle is used to
 * identify last unsuccessfully invoked callback (see POWER_SYS_GetErroneousDriver()) and for callback
 * unregistration (see POWER_SYS_UnregisterCallbackFunction).
 * See power_manager_callback_t for required callback prototype.
 * Following is an example of usage:
 * @code
